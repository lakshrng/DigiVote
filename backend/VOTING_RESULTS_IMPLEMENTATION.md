# Voting and Results Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds voting and results functionality to the DigiVote system.

## New Files Added
- `backend/routes/voting.py` - Voting endpoints
- `backend/routes/results.py` - Results endpoints
- `backend/init_db.py` - Database initialization script
- `backend/test_routes.py` - API testing script
- `backend/Endpoint documentation/VOTING_RESULTS_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API documentation

## Modified Files
- `backend/server.py` - Registered new blueprints
- `backend/database.py` - Added db_session export (if needed)

## Features Implemented

### Voting Routes
1. **GET /api/elections/active** - Get all active elections
2. **GET /api/elections/{id}/ballot** - Get ballot with positions and candidates
3. **GET /api/elections/{id}/voted/{student_id}** - Check if student voted
4. **POST /api/vote** - Submit a vote

### Results Routes
1. **GET /api/elections/completed** - Get completed elections
2. **GET /api/elections/{id}/results** - Get election results
3. **POST /api/elections/{id}/publish** - Publish results (admin)

## Testing
All routes have been tested and are working correctly. See test output in test_routes.py.

## Database Setup
Run `python init_db.py --seed` to initialize database with test data.

## Files Added

### Backend Routes
- `backend/routes/voting.py` - Handles all voting-related endpoints
- `backend/routes/results.py` - Handles results viewing and publishing

### Utilities
- `backend/init_db.py` - Database initialization script with seed data
- `backend/test_routes.py` - Comprehensive API testing script

### Documentation
- `backend/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API reference for all endpoints

## Files Modified
- `backend/server.py` - Registered new blueprints with `/api` prefix
- `backend/database.py` - Added `db_session` export (if needed)

## Implementation Details

### Voting System
The voting system ensures:
- ✅ One vote per student per election (enforced by unique constraint)
- ✅ Only active elections can be voted in
- ✅ Only approved candidates appear on ballot
- ✅ Supports "None of the Above" option (null candidate_id)
- ✅ Vote anonymity maintained (ballot only links who voted, not what they voted)

### Results System
The results system provides:
- ✅ Real-time vote counting
- ✅ Admin access to results during active elections
- ✅ Public access only after election ends
- ✅ Winner determination based on highest vote count
- ✅ NOTA (None of the Above) vote tracking

## Testing Results
All endpoints tested successfully:
- ✅ Vote submission: 201 Created
- ✅ Duplicate vote prevention: 400 Bad Request
- ✅ Results calculation: Accurate vote counts
- ✅ Access control: 403 Forbidden for non-admins during active elections

## Database Schema Used
- `elections` - Election metadata
- `positions` - Positions in each election
- `candidates` - Students running for positions
- `ballots` - Records who voted (maintains link to student)
- `vote_selections` - Actual votes (anonymous, only linked to ballot_id)

## How to Test Locally

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create database
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE "digi-voter";
\q

# Create .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/digi-voter
```

### Initialize Database
```bash
python backend/init_db.py --seed
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
python backend/server.py

# Terminal 2: Run tests
python backend/test_routes.py
```

## API Documentation
See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](backend/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete endpoint reference.

## Future Enhancements
